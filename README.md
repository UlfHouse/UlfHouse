Ulf House here! Learning to code and hoping to move from the emt field into tech via front and back end coding some day. 
More than willing to learn from others and to help those I can along the path!
Enjoy video games, meditation, learning new subjects and skills, and sleeping in!
I have worked for a bit over a decade doing EMS with both County Fire and now in the private sector with Mountain Medical Transport.
The most impressive thing about this new path is the potential to create new and interactive things through the technology of the internet!
As I get further along the course I'll have to flesh this out with some actual code and make it more welcoming and interesting!
