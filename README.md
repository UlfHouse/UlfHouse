  <h1> Hello Github! </h1>
  <p> My name is Ulf and I have recently joined this place in order to help learn to code! Yea, like everybody else but thats why resources like this are so wonderful in       the modern age!</p>
  <p>I currently work full time as an <strong>EMT</strong> at <a href="https://mountainmedicaltransport.com/">MMT</a>! It is a good job with many good people to enjoy working with. I'm looking to get into tech and specifically coding/web dev. I know it is a saturated market, but it seems most <em>approachable</em> and I enjoy a challenge!</p>
